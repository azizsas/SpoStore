# SpoStore
A React application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that enables users to view upcoming and live professional sports games along with real-time betting odds from major bookmakers like DraftKings, FanDuel, and William Hill, which are available in the U.S. Users can filter results by state to ensure they see bookmakers legally operating in their region. The app’s goal is to allow users to track live odds on games they’re interested in, helping them find favorable betting options.

This app currently supports NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB games. It uses AWS Lambda functions to handle external API requests, Redis for efficient in-memory caching, and Sentry for error logging. The project was initially created using Create React App.
